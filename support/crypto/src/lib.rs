//! This crate abstracts over platform-specific crypto libraries (OpenSSL on
//! Linux, BCrypt/WinCrypt on Windows, Security.framework on macOS) so that
//! callers never interact with the underlying backend directly.
//!
//! It is explicitly specialized for the needs of the OpenVMM project and is
//! not suitable for general-purpose use.

// UNSAFETY: calling BCrypt APIs on Windows, Security.framework APIs on macOS.
